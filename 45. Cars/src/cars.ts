//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
// It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, 
// such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

import { features } from "process";

function storeCarInfo(manufacturer: string, modelName: string, ... extraOption: {[key : string]:any }[]):
Object {
    const careinfo ={
manufacturer,
modelName,
...Object.assign({}, ... extraOption)


    }

    return careinfo;
    

}

 let  answer = storeCarInfo('Honda', 'Civis', {colour:'black' },{features: ['Navigation', 'Power Window']} )
console.log(answer);
